# GenSX AI Weather Agent for Telegram and CLI

A smart AI-powered weather assistant that processes natural language queries and provides weather information via Telegram bot or CLI interface. Built with [GenSX](https://gensx.com), a powerful React-like framework for creating AI agents.

## üå§Ô∏è Overview

This project demonstrates how to create an intelligent weather agent that:

- Extracts location information from natural language queries
- Fetches real-time weather data without requiring API keys
- Generates human-like responses with context awareness
- Offers multiple interfaces (Telegram bot and CLI)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- NPM or Yarn
- OpenAI API key
- Telegram Bot Token (optional, for Telegram mode)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sersavan/weather-ai-agent-gensx.git
   cd weather-ai-agent-gensx
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
   MODE=telegram  # or 'console' for CLI mode 
   ```

### Getting a Telegram Bot Token

To use the Telegram bot functionality, you need to create a bot and get its token:

1. Open Telegram and search for [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
2. Start a chat with BotFather and send the command `/newbot`
3. Follow the instructions to name your bot and set a username
4. Once created, BotFather will provide you with a token (looks like `123456789:ABCDefGhIJKlmNoPQRsTUVwxyZ`)
5. Copy this token and paste it as the `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` value in your `.env` file

### Usage

#### Telegram Mode

1. Set `MODE=telegram` in your `.env` file
2. Start the agent:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Find your bot on Telegram and start chatting!

#### Console Mode

1. Set `MODE=console` in your `.env` file
2. Run the agent in console mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Ask questions about the weather in natural language:
   ```
   Your question: What's the weather like in Tokyo?
   ```

## üß© Why GenSX?

GenSX provides an exceptional framework for building AI agents because:

1. **React-like Component System**: If you know React, you already know how to structure GenSX agents with components, props, and state
   
2. **JSX Syntax For AI Workflows**: Visually map complex AI workflows using familiar JSX syntax, making agent design intuitive

3. **Seamless LLM Integration**: Simple integration with OpenAI and other LLM providers with built-in components

4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support means fewer bugs and better development experience

5. **Composability**: Build complex agents from reusable components, making your code DRY and maintainable

6. **Debugging Tools**: Trace execution flows and inspect inputs/outputs of each component

7. **Production-Ready**: Deploy agents with confidence using a framework designed for reliability
